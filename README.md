        <p>
          This package contains a collection of useful classes and tools that I have personally used throughout my games. 
          Originating from Party Crashers, I have been slowly building and involving this kit, and now with Unity Package Manager being "somewhat" stable, I decided to make a github repository so I can better track the changes and synchronise the numerous versions I have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since it is just a "collection of scripts", there isn't much in the ways of a manual or a theme for the package other than "hey thats useful". Since it is all under MIT, you are free to simply extract just the scripts you need, there is no dependencies amongst the files unless explicitly stated in the top of the file (ie: some of the custom editors).

# Usage
Since this is just a folder of scripts, you can use it how you need it. Check out the documentation for more information.

# Installation
There are 3 methods you can use to importing this package:
1. You can download this as a zip and import it directly into unity
2. You can download the `.unitypackage` artifacts in the [latest build pre-release](https://github.com/Lachee/unity-utilities/releases/tag/latest)
3. You can add the package to unity via Unity Package Manager, under the "add git package"


# TODO
List of things I wish to implement:

  - More Surrogates for Binary Formatter
  - My PlayerPrefs from Cross-Platform as it supports Serialization / Deserialization
  - Fix to my Automatic Namespacer with better support for rules
    - I should rewrite this
  - Configuration panel for stuff? Probably not required
